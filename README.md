This is a sample project that uses [rsms/peertalk](https://github.com/rsms/peertalk) to communicate between iOS devices and macOS devices via a USB cable connection.

At the time of creating this project, [rsms/peertalk](https://github.com/rsms/peertalk) does not support Swift Package Manager, so I forked it as [treastrain/peertalk](https://github.com/treastrain/peertalk) and used its [swift-package-manager branch](https://github.com/treastrain/peertalk/tree/swift-package-manager).

The code is shared with using SwiftUI between iOS App and macOS App.
